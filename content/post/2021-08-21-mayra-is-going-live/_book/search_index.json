Similar to Youtube and Instagram lives, Twitch is an online platform that allows someone to interact and share content with others online and in real time. Twitch is most commonly known among video gamers, but I have recently found crafters and coders broadcasting their projects on the platform too! 0.2 Why do I love Twitch? Learning to quilt during COVID-19 has been hard because a lot of the inspiration I get is from Instagram and since my budget is tight, I only buy the materials I need and try to find free online resources. I am beyond fortunate that my mother in-law was learning how to quilt before me because she has been my quilt mentor and has helped me figure out what tools and resources are needed. Even with all this support, there was something missing. I didn’t really know what it was, until I found fellow quilters on Instagram and one of them mentioned going live on Twitch. Out of curiosity, instead of watching a new series or listening to an audio book, I started sewing along with Aidan from PixeInStitches and without even trying, he helped me learn to feel more relaxed when quilting and try new techniques. Since you can watch and follow someone for free, it has been incredibly helpful for me and I find myself no longer feeling the need to pay for quilting classes or quilt guilds. So you might be wondering, that’s great Mayra, why are you telling us this? Well, after months of debating, I have decided I want to start a quilting and coding channel on Twitch! 0.3 Why am I taking this leap? Connection. I hope to continue to meet and build relationships with other fellow creatives. The love for making is infectious and I would love to continue to learn and grow with others. Insight. I don’t think there are many people who know what quilting is and how much time actually goes into making a quilt. My hope is that this channel will showcase how a quilt is made and provide a glimpse into moments when things don’t always go as planned. Similarly, I want to share my process when I code and help people feel more comfortable learning from their mistakes and moving on. Accountability. When it comes to quilting and coding, I have a lot of ideas, but oftentimes I get sidetracked by other projects or jump head first into a project and run out of steam. My goal is to use this streaming time to make progress on these projects and slow down! Clarity. I overthink Instagram and find myself second guessing myself, a lot. My hope is that by streaming on Twitch, it clears up some of that uncertainty. 0.4 Want to join me and hangout? Create a free Twitch account and follow!

summary: Sewing half square triangles (HSTs) and thinking of all the storytellers inspiring me.
---

During week 3 of the Gather Quilt sew along, I created half square triangles (HST) for the first 5 colors of the quilt. During this time, there was a lot of sewing, measuring, and trimming. One thing that fascinated me through this process was how we used the four at a time method to create four triangles from two pieces of square fabric. To speed up the process I used chain piecing and was amazed by how these squares of fabric were transforming in front of my eyes. By the time I finished, I was in awe of what I had made and became excited about the quilt top I was building.This process made me think of all the people who have been inspiring me lately and are able to transform a vision into a quilt. These quilters inspire me, but also challenge what I know about quilting and I love it. Below are just a few quilters whose creations have reminded me to be bold, be creative, and go with what feels right.

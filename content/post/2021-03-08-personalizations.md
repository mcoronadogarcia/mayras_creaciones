summary: The beginning of a journey to remind myself that my worth isn't determined by how much I get done.

In the beginning of this journey, I had promised myself to not seam rip any part of the quilt unless it impacted the overall structure. This really helped me look at my “mistakes'' as personalizations. From week one to week seven, there were so many personalizations! A couple of times I had cut something too short, another time I sewed a strip backwards, and even flipped a row. Don’t get me wrong, the decision to not seam rip took a lot of effort, but it led me to improvise and enjoy the process of learning.

One of the biggest lessons that I learned throughout this sew a long was that I am terrible at knowing how long a task will take me. This is something I thought I got better at and this project reminded me that there is always room for improvement. There were a couple times when a task took me longer than I expected and instead of stopping I would push myself to finish. This led me to making errors and not enjoying myself. Thankfully this only happened a handful of times, but it reminded me of how society has taught us to associate our worth by the amount of things we can get done. So in an effort to unlearn this belief, I am planning to focus more on setting time aside for myself rather than focusing on what I can accomplish.

title: Unlearning
summary: Over the past few weeks, I have been learning more about my beliefs and begun to recognize that there are things we are taught that we need to unlearn.

As I was sewing the rows together I was excited to see the quilt top form! After the first few rows the quilt started becoming heavier and heavier and it became a lot harder to sew the rows together straight. I am thankful for Suzy’s blog this week because pinning and sewing slowly became an important part of the process and once I found my rhythm, I couldn’t stop! 

When I finally called it a day, I hung up the quilt top and its shape reminded me of a home and the lessons my parents taught me. Having to navigate a new country with minimal resources was challenging, but no matter what obstacle came our way, my parents reminded us to never give up, to work hard, and to be grateful. These lessons have helped me tremendously in life, but as I’ve been learning more about my beliefs, I have also grown to recognize that there are things we are taught that we need to unlearn.

One of those beliefs was that tears showed weakness. This wasn’t something explicitly said to me, but something society taught me and that was reinforced. This belief made me hide anytime I felt like I was going to start crying, especially when my tears were because I was sad or mad. Over the years, I have been trying to unlearn this belief. This hasn’t been a perfect journey, but I am thankful that I have friends and family that have helped me along the way.
